# MAYSB Website Project Log

## Project Overview
Complete website redesign for Maryland Association of Youth Service Bureaus (MAYSB) - a professional nonprofit association website focused on trust, credibility, and clear communication.

## Design Philosophy
- **Trustworthy & Institutional**: Deep blues, clean typography, professional layout
- **Human & Community-Centered**: Real photography focus, accessible language
- **Clear & Navigable**: Simple navigation, predictable structure
- **Quietly Confident**: Subtle animations, no flashy trends

## Key Design Decisions

### Color Palette
- Primary: Deep navy (#1e3a5f) - signals trust and stability
- Accent: Muted gold (#c9a961) - warm but professional
- Background: Off-white (#f8f7f4) - softer than pure white
- Avoided: Neon colors, gradients, AI-aesthetic trends

### Typography
- Headings: Georgia serif - traditional, trustworthy
- Body: System sans-serif stack - highly readable
- Prioritized legibility over brand personality

### Information Architecture
- 6 primary navigation items (max recommended)
- Persistent navigation
- Text-first approach (icons secondary)
- Clear hierarchy and scannability

## Site Structure

### Homepage Sections (6 required)
1. **Hero**: Mission-driven headline, clear CTAs, authentic imagery placeholder
2. **What YSBs Do**: 4 pillars with grounded icons
3. **Proven Impact**: Metrics, longevity emphasis, policy alignment
4. **Events Preview**: Card-based event listings
5. **Who We Serve**: Three audience segments
6. **Call to Engagement**: Three engagement pathways

### Additional Pages Created
- About MAYSB
- Youth Service Bureaus
- Programs & Services
- Events & Training
- Resources & Advocacy
- Contact

- `index.html` - Homepage with all 6 sections
- `styles.css` - Complete design system with CSS variables
- `script.js` - Mobile menu functionality

### CSS Architecture
- CSS variables for consistent theming

## Content Strategy

### Tone & Voice

## What Was Avoided
